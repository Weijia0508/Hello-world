          <p>
            Since 5 years ago , that was my first time came alone to this country (Taiwan).<br>
            The purpose I came here was further my studies.<br>
            In the first year , I studied foundation cousre in Taiwan. <br>
            This foundation course help those overseas students to build up their language level and make us more adapt in the course material in here.<br>
            After one year of studied.I get lucky to become a student in National Cheng Kung University.<br>
